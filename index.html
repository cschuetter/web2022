        <p>Hi, my name is Christian Schuetter,
          and I am a junior at the University of Kentucky
          studying Information Communication Technology with a minor in Computer Science.
          The purpose of this website is to serve as a showcase of some of the work and
          achievements that I have accomplished during my time as a student.

          I became interested in the cybersecurity field when I was young after listening to my dad talk about his day at work at the dinner table. I have kept that same interest and expanded upon it as I graduated high school and entered college. I have taken a particular interest in IT policy and how relationships between people, companies, and governments are affected by IT and IT policies. I expanded on this interest by writing a 4500-word analysis of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), investigating the purpose and features of the GDPR, creating comparisons between the GDPR and US data privacy laws, and offering my own thoughts as to whether or not the US should consider creating a similar data protection policy. You may find a copy of that analysis attached below.
          <br>
          In addition to my studies at the University of Kentucky, I am currently enrolled in the SANS Undergraduate Certificate in Applied Cybersecurity program. Through this program, I am taking courses working towards earning 4 SANS certifications in cybersecurity as a college student.
          <br>
          Other facts about me: <br>
          &#x27a4;I am an Eagle Scout, and was named Scout of the Year in 2019 by the Veterans of Foreign Wars, Kentucky branch.<br>
          &#x27a4;I am a graduate of National Youth Leadership Training, the Boy Scouts of America's youth leadership training program.<br>
          &#x27a4;I am a graduate of the Governor's Scholars Program at Morehead State University the summer before my senior year of high school. I was hand-selected along with near 1,000 of Kentucky's brightest students from among several thousand applications.<br>
          &#x27a4;I have served a year on the state board of the Kentucky branch of the Junior Classical League, an organization dedicated to promoting Latin and Greek in high schools.<br>
